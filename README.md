# Modular Blockchain Project

## Overview

This project is a minimalistic blockchain application built with Python and Flask. It demonstrates basic blockchain concepts, including block creation, proof of work, and transaction management. The application provides a simple web interface for interacting with the blockchain.

## Project Structure

- `blockchain.py`: Contains the blockchain logic, including block creation, proof of work, and smart contract functionalities.
- `app.py`: Flask application providing web routes for mining blocks, creating transactions, and viewing the blockchain.
- `index.html`: Home page of the application with navigation options.
- `chain.html`: Page for viewing the blockchain chain.
- `transaction.html`: Page for creating new transactions.
- `mine.html`: Page for mining new blocks.
- `main.js`: Main JavaScript file for basic functionality (if applicable).
- `chain.js`: JavaScript for displaying the blockchain chain.
- `transaction.js`: JavaScript for handling new transactions.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the application.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Flask (included in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask Server**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The application will start and be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

2. **Access the Web Interface**

   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You will see the home page with options to mine a block, create a new transaction, and view the blockchain chain.

## Usage

- **Home Page (`index.html`)**: Provides links to mine a block, create a transaction, and view the blockchain.
- **Mine a Block (`mine.html`)**: Click the "Mine Block" button to mine a new block and add it to the blockchain.
- **Create a Transaction (`transaction.html`)**: Submit a form to create a new transaction, specifying the sender, recipient, and amount.
- **View Chain (`chain.html`)**: Displays the current blockchain chain in a tabular format.

## Project Files

- `blockchain.py`: Contains classes and methods for the blockchain, including block creation, proof of work, and transactions.
- `app.py`: The main Flask application handling HTTP routes and rendering HTML templates.
- `index.html`: The main page with navigation options.
- `chain.html`: Page displaying the blockchain.
- `transaction.html`: Page for creating transactions.
- `mine.html`: Page for mining blocks.
- `main.js`, `chain.js`, `transaction.js`: JavaScript files for handling front-end logic.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the web pages.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages.
